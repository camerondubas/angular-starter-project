The Fee is negotiated with each Partner and therefore may be different for each Campaign.

For more information about our collection and use of Billing Information, see the Privacy Policy. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3 c6\">PAYMENT PROCESSING</span><span class=\"c3\">. We use third party payment processors in order to facilitate Donations (the &ldquo;</span><span class=\"c2\">Payment Processor</span><span class=\"c3\">&rdquo;). As a result, Billing Information is not stored on our system and is therefore not governed by this Agreement or our Privacy Policy but is governed by such Payment Processor&rsquo;s terms and conditions.

You may request to prematurely end such term of recurrence by contacting us at <a href=\"mailto:support@changeheroes.com\">support@changeheroes.com</a>. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><a name=\"h.17dp8vu\"></a><span class=\"c3 c6\">TAX RECEIPTS</span><span class=\"c3\">. &nbsp;You may receive a tax receipt from Change Heroes for your Donation on behalf of the associated Partner (the &ldquo;</span><span class=\"c2\">Tax Receipt</span><span class=\"c3\">&rdquo;). We only provide this service when: (a) we have express permission from the applicable Partner to do so; and (b) such Partner is a registered charity or otherwise has the legal right to issue tax receipts for donations in its jurisdiction. Tax Receipts are automatically generated by Change Heroes. They are generated upon confirmation that the associated Partner receives the Donation.
